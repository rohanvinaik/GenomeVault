"""
Target mode configuration for Semgrep Scan

It's important to note that the targeting schemes differ among three scanning
modes: pro (interfile) differential scanning, open-source (per-file)
differential scanning, and whole scan. Here's a breakdown of their respective
targeting requirements:

OSS Diff Scan: For OSS differential scanning, the files that have changed
between the head and baseline commits serve as the primary "targets".

Whole Scan: In the case of the whole scan, all input files are categorized as
"targets" without any distinction based on commit changes.
