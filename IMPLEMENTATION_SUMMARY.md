## Usage

To use the current implementation:

```python
# Install the package
pip install -e .

# Run the example
python examples/basic_usage.py

# Or use in your code
from genomevault import SequencingProcessor, get_config

config = get_config()
processor = SequencingProcessor()
# Process your genomic data...
```

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
2. **Documentation**: Expand API documentation with Sphinx
