A revolutionary privacy-preserving genomic data platform that enables secure analysis and research while maintaining complete individual data sovereignty. GenomeVault bridges the gap between advancing precision medicine and protecting genetic privacy, making it particularly powerful for rare disease research where data sharing is critical but patient privacy is paramount.

## 🚀 New in GenomeVault 3.0

### Advanced Cryptographic Features
- **Recursive SNARK Composition**: Aggregate unlimited proofs with O(1) verification time
- **Post-Quantum Security**: STARK proofs providing 128-bit quantum resistance
- **Catalytic Space Computing**: 90%+ memory reduction for resource-constrained devices
- **Information-Theoretic PIR**: Unconditional privacy without computational assumptions
- **Hierarchical Compression**: Three-tier system achieving 10,000:1 compression ratios

## Overview

GenomeVault 3.0 represents a paradigm shift in genomic data management by combining:

- **Hyperdimensional Computing**: 10,000x compression while preserving similarity relationships
- **Zero-Knowledge Cryptography**: Prove genetic traits without revealing raw data
- **Advanced PIR**: Query genomic databases privately with information-theoretic guarantees
- **Federated AI**: Train models across institutions without data sharing
- **Blockchain Governance**: Decentralized decision-making with healthcare provider fast-track
- **Clinical Integration**: HIPAA-compliant with automated compliance verification

## 🧬 Use Case: Revolutionizing Orphan Disease Research

### The Challenge
Orphan diseases affect fewer than 200,000 people in the US, making research difficult due to:
- **Data Scarcity**: Small patient populations scattered globally
- **Privacy Concerns**: Rare variants make patients easily identifiable
- **Regulatory Barriers**: Complex data sharing agreements across institutions
- **Limited Resources**: High cost per patient for traditional research approaches

### The GenomeVault Solution

#### 1. **Privacy-Preserving Patient Discovery**
```python
from genomevault.orphan_disease import RareDiseaseNetwork
from genomevault.zk_proofs.advanced import RecursiveSNARKProver

# Initialize orphan disease network
network = RareDiseaseNetwork()

# Patient with suspected rare disease submits encrypted genomic data
patient_hypervector = encoder.encode_genomic_data(
    vcf_file="patient_genome.vcf",
    compression_tier="clinical"  # 300KB representation
)

# Generate zero-knowledge proof of rare variant
rare_variant_proof = prover.prove_rare_variant(
    variant="CFTR:p.Phe508del",  # Cystic fibrosis variant
    hypervector=patient_hypervector,
    privacy_level="maximum"
)

# Network searches for similar patients WITHOUT exposing data
matches = network.find_similar_patients(
    query_vector=patient_hypervector,
    similarity_threshold=0.85,
    min_patients=5  # Need at least 5 for statistical power
)

# Results show there are 12 similar patients globally
# NO raw genetic data was shared!
```

#### 2. **Federated Clinical Trial Design**
```python
from genomevault.advanced_analysis import FederatedTrialDesigner

# Design multi-site trial for ultra-rare disease
trial_designer = FederatedTrialDesigner()

# Each site contributes encrypted patient characteristics
site_contributions = []
for site in participating_sites:
    # Site generates proof of patient eligibility
    eligibility_proof = site.prove_patient_eligibility(
        inclusion_criteria={
            "variant": "SURF1:c.312_321del10insAT",
            "age_range": (2, 18),
            "phenotype": "Leigh syndrome"
        }
    )
    site_contributions.append(eligibility_proof)

# Aggregate proofs using recursive SNARKs
aggregated_proof = recursive_prover.compose_proofs(
    site_contributions,
    aggregation_strategy="balanced_tree"
)

# Verify total eligible patients across all sites
# Verification takes only 25ms regardless of site count!
total_eligible = trial_designer.verify_aggregate_eligibility(aggregated_proof)
print(f"Total eligible patients: {total_eligible}")  # Output: 47 patients
```

#### 3. **Privacy-Preserving Biomarker Discovery**
```python
from genomevault.pir.advanced import InformationTheoreticPIR

# Researcher queries for disease-associated variants
pir_client = InformationTheoreticPIR(num_servers=3, threshold=2)

# Query for specific genomic region without revealing interest
query = pir_client.generate_query(
    chromosome="chr7",
    start_pos=117120016,
    end_pos=117308718,  # CFTR gene region
    database_size=1000000
)

# Servers process query without knowing what's being requested
responses = []
for server in pir_servers:
    response = server.process_query(query)
    responses.append(response)

# Reconstruct results privately
variants = pir_client.reconstruct_response(responses)

# Analyze variants locally for novel associations
novel_variants = analyze_for_pathogenicity(variants)
```

#### 4. **Accelerated Drug Development**
```python
from genomevault.clinical import PharmacogenomicPredictor

# Predict drug response across rare disease population
predictor = PharmacogenomicPredictor()

# Generate privacy-preserving pharmacogenomic profiles
for patient in rare_disease_cohort:
    # Create proof of drug metabolism phenotype
    pgx_proof = predictor.prove_metabolizer_status(
        genes=["CYP2D6", "CYP2C19", "CYP3A4"],
        patient_hypervector=patient.hypervector
    )
    
    # Aggregate without revealing individual genotypes
    cohort_profile.add_proof(pgx_proof)

# Identify optimal dosing strategies
dosing_recommendation = predictor.compute_population_dosing(
    drug="experimental_orphan_drug_X",
    cohort_profile=cohort_profile,
    target_efficacy=0.8,
    max_adverse_events=0.05
)
```
