# GenomeVault 3.0

GenomeVault 3.0 is a privacy-first multi-omics intelligence platform that enables population-scale genomic research without centralized data repositories. By combining hyperdimensional computing, zero-knowledge cryptography, and federated AI, our platform achieves what was previously thought impossible: enabling secure genomic analysis while maintaining absolute privacy.

## Key Features

- **Complete Data Sovereignty**: Your genomic data never leaves your device in raw form
- **Hypervector Encoding**: 10,000x compression while preserving biological relationships
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Verify analytical results without revealing genetic information
- **Distributed Reference**: N-server PIR architecture ensures query privacy
- **Blockchain Governance**: Dual-axis node model enables democratic protocol evolution

## Technical Specifications

### Compression Tiers
- **Mini tier**: ~5,000 most-studied SNPs (~25 KB)
- **Clinical tier**: ACMG + PharmGKB variants (~120k) (~300 KB)
- **Full HDC tier**: 10,000-D vectors per modality (100-200 KB)

### Performance Metrics
- Processing time: Full genome analysis in under 10 minutes on consumer hardware
- Proof generation: Zero-knowledge proofs in under 1 minute with GPU acceleration
- Network footprint: Less than 60KB of data leaving your device
- Storage requirements: Under 5GB for complete genome analysis
- Security level: 256-bit post-quantum protection

### PIR Network
- Privacy breach probability: P_fail(k,q) = (1-q)^k
- Server honesty: q = 0.98 for HIPAA TS, 0.95 for generic
- Typical latency: 210-350ms based on configuration

### Dual-Axis Node Model
- Node-class axis (resources):
  - Light nodes (c=1): Consumer hardware
  - Full nodes (c=4): Standard servers
  - Archive nodes (c=8): High-performance systems
- Signatory status axis (trust):
  - Non-signer (s=0)
  - Trusted Signatory (s=10)
- Total voting power: w = c + s
