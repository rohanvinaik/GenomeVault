# GenomeVault 3.0

A revolutionary platform that enables individuals to analyze their genetic data and participate in medical research while maintaining complete privacy and control.

## Overview

GenomeVault uses advanced mathematics, cryptography, and AI to ensure your DNA remains secure while still allowing for powerful genomic analyses and scientific discovery.

## Key Features

- **Complete Privacy**: Zero-knowledge proofs ensure your genetic data never leaves your control
- **Multi-Omics Support**: Integrated analysis of genomics, transcriptomics, epigenetics, and proteomics
- **Hyperdimensional Computing**: Advanced vector representations for privacy-preserving analysis
- **Blockchain Integration**: Decentralized trust and governance
- **Clinical Applications**: Real-world healthcare integration with HIPAA compliance

## Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

1. **Local Processing**: Secure containerized processing of biological data
2. **Hypervector Transform**: High-dimensional encodings that preserve privacy
3. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Mathematical verification without data exposure
4. **PIR Network**: Distributed reference genome access
5. **Blockchain Layer**: Decentralized governance and verification
6. **Advanced Analysis**: AI and mathematical tools for research

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 16+ (for blockchain components)
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended for ZK proof generation)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/genomevault.git
cd genomevault

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Setup local processing containers
docker-compose build
```

### Quick Start

1. **Initialize a node**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup/init_node.sh --type light
   ```

2. **Process your genomic data**:
   ```bash
   python -m local_processing.pipeline --input your_genome.vcf
   ```

3. **Generate privacy-preserving representation**:
   ```bash
   python -m hypervector.encoding.genomic --compress clinical
   ```
