## GenomeVault Security Model

### Overview
GenomeVault implements a defense-in-depth security architecture to protect genomic and clinical data at rest, in transit, and during computation. This document outlines our threat model, security guarantees, and vulnerability reporting process.

## Threat Model Matrix

| Asset | Adversary | Threat | Mitigation | Implementation |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Genomic Data | Curious Servers | Data content inference | IT-PIR | 2-server XOR scheme |
| Clinical Data | Malicious Servers | False data injection | Byzantine FT | Reed-Solomon ECC |
| Query Patterns | Network Adversary | Traffic analysis | Fixed-size responses | 1KB padded blocks |
| Model Parameters | Statistical Adversary | Parameter extraction | ZK proofs | Groth16 SNARKs |
| Access Logs | Internal Threat | Audit trail analysis | Differential Privacy | ε=1.0 noise addition |
| User Identity | Collusion Attack | Identity linkage | k-anonymity | 5-server minimum |

### PIR-Specific Threats

| Threat | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Residual Risk |
|--------|--------|------------|-------------|---------------|

## Threat Model

### Assets
1. **Genomic Data**
   - Raw sequencing data (FASTQ, BAM files)
   - Processed variants (VCF files)
   - Genomic annotations and metadata

2. **Clinical Data**
   - Diagnoses and medical histories
   - Medications and treatment records
   - Lab results and biomarkers

3. **Query Patterns**
   - What data users search for
   - Access patterns and frequencies
   - Computational workloads

4. **Model Parameters**
   - Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) weights
   - Machine learning model parameters
   - Research algorithms and protocols

### Adversaries

#### 1. Curious Servers
- **Capability**: Follow protocol correctly but attempt to learn information
- **Goal**: Infer data content or access patterns
- **Mitigation**: Information-theoretic PIR ensures zero information leakage

#### 2. Malicious Servers
- **Capability**: Deviate from protocol, send corrupted responses
- **Goal**: Disrupt service or leak false information
- **Mitigation**: Byzantine fault tolerance with Reed-Solomon error correction

#### 3. Network Adversary
- **Capability**: Observe all network traffic
- **Goal**: Infer query patterns or data content
- **Mitigation**: End-to-end encryption, fixed-size responses

#### 4. Statistical Adversary
- **Capability**: Analyze outputs over time
- **Goal**: Infer sensitive information through statistical analysis
- **Mitigation**: Differential privacy for aggregate queries

### Security Properties

#### Information-Theoretic Privacy
- **Property**: Zero information leakage even against computationally unbounded adversaries
- **Implementation**: k-server IT-PIR with non-colluding server assumption
- **Guarantee**: ε = 0 privacy if at least one server is honest

#### Privacy Breach Probability
For k servers with collusion probability q:
- P_breach = q^k
- HIPAA Trust Score nodes: q = 0.98
- Generic nodes: q = 0.95
- Example: k=2 servers with q=0.98 gives P_breach = 0.96%

#### Byzantine Fault Tolerance
- Tolerate up to t = ⌊(n-1)/3⌋ malicious servers
- Requires n ≥ 3t + 1 total servers
- Reed-Solomon error correction for response recovery

## Mitigations

### 1. IT-PIR (Information-Theoretic Private Information Retrieval)
```python
# Zero-knowledge data retrieval
query = pir.generate_query(item_index)
responses = [server.process(query) for server in servers]
data = pir.reconstruct(responses)
```

**Guarantees**:
- Information-theoretic privacy against k-1 colluding servers
- No computational assumptions required
- Proven secure even against quantum computers

### 2. Zero-Knowledge Proofs
```python
# Prove properties without revealing data
proof = zk.prove_prs_in_range(score, min_val, max_val)
valid = zk.verify(proof, public_inputs)
```

**Applications**:
- Prove PRS scores are in valid ranges
- Verify computation correctness
- Authenticate data ownership

### 3. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) Encoding
```python
# One-way transformation to hypervectors
hv = hdc.encode_variant(variant_data)
# Original data cannot be recovered from hv
```

**Properties**:
- Lossy compression (1000:1 ratio)
- Preserves similarity relationships
- Computationally infeasible to invert

### 4. Differential Privacy
```python
# Add calibrated noise to aggregates
true_count = 100
private_count = dp.add_noise(true_count, epsilon=1.0)
```

**Parameters**:
- ε = 1.0 for high utility
- ε = 0.1 for strong privacy
- Composition theorems for multiple queries

## Attack Mitigation Strategies

### Timing Attacks
- **Threat**: Infer accessed items from response time
- **Mitigation**: Constant-time query processing
- **Implementation**: Process all database items regardless of query

### Size Attacks
- **Threat**: Infer data from response sizes
- **Mitigation**: Fixed-size responses with padding
- **Implementation**: All responses are exactly 1024 bytes

### Replay Attacks
- **Threat**: Reuse old queries or responses
- **Mitigation**: Query nonces and timestamps
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  query.nonce = random_bytes(16)
  query.timestamp = current_time()
  ```

### Correlation Attacks
- **Threat**: Correlate multiple queries to infer patterns
- **Mitigation**: Query randomization and mixing
- **Implementation**: Add dummy queries and shuffle order

## Cryptographic Primitives

### Hash Functions
- **Primary**: SHA-256 for general hashing
- **SNARK-friendly**: Poseidon hash for in-circuit hashing
- **Key Derivation**: Argon2id for password hashing

### Encryption
- **Symmetric**: AES-256-GCM for data encryption
- **Asymmetric**: Curve25519 for key exchange
- **Homomorphic**: BFV scheme for encrypted computation

### Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems
- **SNARK Backend**: Groth16 on BN254 curve
- **Recursive SNARKs**: Nova-based folding scheme
- **Post-Quantum**: Lattice-based proofs (experimental)
