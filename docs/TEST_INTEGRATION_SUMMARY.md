# Test Infrastructure Integration Summary

## What Was Added

### 1. Test Files
- `tests/test_compression.py` - Comprehensive tests for compression tiers
- `tests/test_hypervector.py` - Tests for hypervector operations
- `tests/unit/test_diabetes_pilot.py` - Tests for diabetes risk calculator
- `tests/conftest.py` - Shared pytest fixtures and configuration
- `tests/test_smoke.py` - Basic smoke tests
- `tests/fixtures/sample_variants.json` - Test data

### 2. CI/CD Configuration
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Complete GitHub Actions pipeline
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` - Bug report and feature request templates
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` - PR template

### 3. Development Tools
- `setup-dev.sh` - Automated development environment setup
- `run-tests.sh` - Test runner with multiple options
- `Makefile` - Common development tasks
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hooks configuration
- `docker-compose.test.yml` - Test services configuration

### 4. Configuration Files
- Updated `pyproject.toml` with comprehensive test settings
- Created `setup.cfg` for flake8 configuration
- Updated `requirements-dev.txt` with all test dependencies

### 5. Documentation
- `docs/TESTING.md` - Comprehensive testing guide

## Quick Start

1. **Initial Setup**
   ```bash
   ./setup-dev.sh
   ```

2. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   make test          # Run all tests
   make coverage      # Generate coverage report
   ./run-tests.sh ci  # Run full CI suite locally
   ```

3. **Pre-commit Hooks**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install  # Already done by setup-dev.sh
   ```

## Key Features

### Test Coverage
- Configured for 80% minimum coverage
- Branch coverage enabled
- HTML and XML reports
- Integration with Codecov

### Test Organization
- Unit tests for compression and hypervector operations
- Integration test structure ready
- Performance benchmarking support
- Security testing framework

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Multi-stage pipeline (lint, test, security, build)
- Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 compatibility testing
- Security scanning with Bandit and Semgrep
- Docker build and smoke tests

### Developer Experience
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Multiple test runners (Makefile, run-tests.sh)
- VS Code integration ready
- Watch mode for TDD

## Next Steps

1. **Run Initial Tests**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_smoke.py -v
   ```

2. **Check Coverage Baseline**
   ```bash
   make coverage
   open htmlcov/index.html
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Actions**
   - Push to GitHub
   - CI will run automatically on push/PR

4. **Add More Tests**
   - Add tests for existing modules
   - Aim for 80%+ coverage
   - Add integration tests for PIR, blockchain, etc.

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify test setup
pytest --version
black --version
flake8 --version

# Run quick smoke test
pytest tests/test_smoke.py -v

# Check if pre-commit is installed
pre-commit --version

# Run pre-commit on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Maintenance

- Keep dependencies updated: `pip-compile requirements-dev.in`
- Monitor test performance: `pytest --durations=10`
- Review coverage regularly: `make coverage`
- Update test fixtures as needed

The test infrastructure is now fully integrated and ready for use!
