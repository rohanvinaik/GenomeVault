# GenomeVault Accuracy Dial - Updated Design

## Accuracy Range: 90% - 99.99%

The accuracy dial has been updated to reflect realistic genomic analysis requirements:

### Why 90% Minimum?
- **Clinical Relevance**: 90% accuracy is the minimum threshold for meaningful genomic screening
- **Iterative Refinement**: Lower accuracy queries can be iteratively refined to reach higher precision
- **Privacy Preserved**: All accuracy levels maintain full cryptographic privacy protection

### Accuracy Levels and Use Cases

| Accuracy Range | Use Case | Compute Cost | SNP Panel | Response Time |
|----------------|----------|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| 90-92% | Initial population screening | Low | Off | ~200-250ms |
| 92-95% | Research cohort analysis | Medium | Common (1M SNPs) | ~250-350ms |
| 95-98% | Clinical variant analysis | High | Clinical (10M SNPs) | ~400-600ms |
| 98-99.5% | Precision medicine | Very High | Clinical | ~600-1000ms |
| 99.5-99.9% | Diagnostic confirmation | Maximum | Full dbSNP | ~1000-1500ms |
| 99.9-99.99% | Ultra-precision genomics | Extreme | Ultra-High | ~1500-2500ms |

### Key Improvements

1. **Realistic Baseline**: Starting at 90% instead of 50% reflects actual genomic analysis needs
2. **Fine-grained Control**: 0.01% increments allow ultra-precise accuracy tuning
3. **SNP Panel Integration**: Automatically selects appropriate variant panel based on accuracy
4. **Exponential Scaling**: Query time increases exponentially with accuracy, reflecting computational reality

### Technical Details

**Hypervector Dimensions**:
- 90-95%: 10,000 dimensions
- 95-98%: 50,000 dimensions  
- 98-99.9%: 100,000 dimensions
- 99.9%+: 200,000 dimensions (ultra-high precision)

**Error Bounds**:
- Johnson-Lindenstrauss theorem ensures ≤ε relative error
- ε = (100 - accuracy) / 100
- Example: 95% accuracy → 5% maximum relative error

**Iteration Strategy**:
- Start with lower accuracy for fast initial results
- Refine iteratively to reach target precision
- Each iteration reduces error by ~√2

### Privacy Guarantees

**All accuracy levels provide**:
- Zero-knowledge proofs of computation
- Differential privacy protection
- Secure multi-party computation
- No raw genomic data exposure

The trade-off is purely computational efficiency vs. result precision, NOT privacy vs. accuracy.

### Example Query Flow

1. **Initial Query (92% accuracy)**:
   - Fast response: ~250ms
   - Common SNP panel
   - Suitable for population-level insights

2. **Refinement (95% accuracy)**:
   - Medium latency: ~350ms
   - Adds rare variant analysis
   - Clinical research grade

3. **Final Confirmation (98% accuracy)**:
   - Higher latency: ~600ms
   - Full clinical panel
   - Diagnostic quality

This progressive refinement approach balances speed with accuracy while maintaining constant privacy protection.
