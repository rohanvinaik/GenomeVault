print("\n📋 ISSUE FIXED:")
print("   - Missing 'zk_proofs.circuits.biological.base_circuits' module")

print("\n🔧 ROOT CAUSE:")
print("   - Incorrect relative import path in variant.py")
print("   - Was using: from .base_circuits import ...")
print("   - This looked for base_circuits.py in the biological/ subdirectory")

print("\n✅ SOLUTION APPLIED:")
print("   - Changed import to: from ..base_circuits import ...")
