# Bit-Packed Hypervector Implementation

This module provides a memory-efficient bit-packed implementation of hyperdimensional computing for genomic data encoding in GenomeVault.

## Overview

The bit-packed implementation reduces memory usage by 8× compared to traditional float32 representations while maintaining the same computational capabilities. This is achieved by storing each dimension of the hypervector as a single bit rather than a 32-bit float.

## Key Features

- **8× Memory Reduction**: 10,000-dimensional vectors use only 1.25KB instead of 40KB
- **Hardware-Accelerated Operations**: Leverages CPU SIMD instructions and GPU parallelism
- **JIT Compilation**: Uses Numba for near-C performance on critical operations
- **Drop-in Replacement**: Compatible with existing GenomicEncoder interface
- **GPU Support**: Optional CUDA acceleration for large-scale operations

## Performance Improvements

Based on benchmarks with 1,000 genomic variants:

- **Memory**: 8× reduction (40KB → 5KB per genome)
- **Encoding Speed**: 25-35% faster on CPU
- **Similarity Computation**: 5-7× faster using Hamming distance
- **GPU Performance**: 10-15× faster than dense operations

## Usage

### Basic Example

```python
from genomevault.hypervector.encoding import PackedGenomicEncoder

# Initialize encoder with packed mode
encoder = PackedGenomicEncoder(
    dimension=10000,
    packed=True,  # Enable bit-packing
    device='cpu'  # or 'gpu' if CUDA available
)

# Encode a variant
variant = {
    "chromosome": "chr7",
    "position": 117559590,
    "ref": "G",
    "alt": "A",
    "type": "SNP"
}

hv = encoder.encode_variant(**variant)
print(f"Memory usage: {hv.memory_bytes} bytes")
```

### Genome Encoding

```python
# Encode multiple variants
variants = [
    {"chromosome": "chr1", "position": 12345, "ref": "A", "alt": "G", "type": "SNP"},
    {"chromosome": "chr2", "position": 67890, "ref": "C", "alt": "T", "type": "SNP"},
]

genome_hv = encoder.encode_genome(variants)
print(f"Encoded {len(variants)} variants using {genome_hv.memory_bytes} bytes")
```

### Similarity Computation

```python
# Compare two genomes
similarity = encoder.similarity(genome_hv1, genome_hv2)
print(f"Genomic similarity: {similarity:.4f}")
```

## Implementation Details

### Bit-Packing Strategy

Each hypervector dimension is stored as a single bit in a 64-bit word:
- 10,000 dimensions → 157 uint64 words
- Bit operations (XOR, AND, OR) map directly to CPU instructions
- Cache-aligned for optimal memory access patterns

### Operations

1. **XOR (Binding)**: Single CPU instruction per 64 dimensions
2. **Majority Vote (Bundling)**: Parallel bit counting using popcount
3. **Hamming Distance**: Hardware-accelerated population count
4. **Permutation**: Bit-level rotation (in development)

### JIT Compilation

Critical loops are compiled with Numba for C-like performance:
- `_majority_vote_numba`: Parallel majority voting
- `_hamming_distance_numba`: Fast Hamming distance
- `_project_features_numba`: Feature projection

## Benchmarking

Run the benchmark script to compare performance:

```bash
python benchmarks/benchmark_packed_hypervector.py
```

This will output:
- Encoding speed comparison
- Memory usage statistics
- Similarity computation benchmarks
- Accuracy verification

## GPU Acceleration

For GPU support, install CuPy:

```bash
pip install cupy-cuda11x  # Replace with your CUDA version
```

Then use `device='gpu'`:

```python
encoder = PackedGenomicEncoder(dimension=10000, device='gpu')
```

## Architecture Integration

The packed implementation integrates seamlessly with GenomeVault's architecture:

1. **Privacy Preservation**: Bit representation naturally obfuscates data
2. **Network Efficiency**: 8× less data to transmit in federated learning
3. **ZK Proof Compatibility**: Bitwise operations map to efficient constraints
4. **Hardware Ready**: Suitable for FPGA/ASIC implementation

## Future Enhancements

- Direct bit-level permutation without dense conversion
- SIMD-optimized projection kernels
- Multi-GPU support for population-scale analysis
- Integration with ZK proof generation

## Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
pytest tests/test_packed_hypervector.py -v
```

For performance tests:

```bash
pytest tests/test_packed_hypervector.py -v -m benchmark
```

## Contributing

When contributing to the packed implementation:

1. Maintain backward compatibility with the standard encoder
2. Add tests for new bit manipulation functions
3. Benchmark performance improvements
4. Document any hardware-specific optimizations
