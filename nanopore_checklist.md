- [x] Proper imports organized
- [x] Docstrings for all classes and methods
- [x] Error handling implemented
- [x] Logging added for debugging

## Testing ✓
- [x] Created test_nanopore_integration.py
- [x] Example usage in each module
- [x] Synthetic data generation for testing
- [x] Performance benchmarking included

## Documentation ✓
- [x] Comprehensive README.md in nanopore/
- [x] API endpoint documentation
- [x] CLI usage examples
- [x] Architecture diagrams in comments
- [x] Biological signal descriptions

## Integration ✓
- [x] Added to main API router
- [x] FastAPI endpoints implemented
- [x] WebSocket support for real-time updates
- [x] Export formats (BedGraph, BED, JSON)

## Performance ✓
- [x] Streaming architecture (bounded memory)
- [x] GPU acceleration optional
- [x] Catalytic memory management
- [x] Async/await for non-blocking I/O

## Privacy ✓
- [x] Zero-knowledge proof generation
- [x] No raw sequence exposure
- [x] Anomaly maps only
- [x] Configurable privacy thresholds

## Dependencies
Note: The following optional dependencies should be documented:
- ont-fast5-api (for Fast5 file reading)
- h5py (for HDF5 support)
- cupy (optional, for GPU acceleration)

## Known Limitations
- MinKNOW real-time streaming is placeholder
- GPU kernels require CUDA-capable GPU
- Simplified event detection (production would use proper basecaller)

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] MinKNOW API integration
- [ ] Multi-GPU support
- [ ] Advanced basecalling integration
- [ ] Real-time visualization dashboard
